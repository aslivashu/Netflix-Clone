Netflix Clone

This project is a front-end clone of Netflix, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a sleek interface inspired by the official site, including browsing movies and shows. As I learn backend development, future updates will add features like user authentication, watch history, and dynamic content management.

Feel free to explore and suggest improvements!
